Description: Power analysis for regression models which test the interaction 
    of two independent variables on a single dependent variable. Includes 
    options for continuous, binary, and/or skewed variables, as well as 
    correlated interacting variables. Also includes options to specify 
    variable reliability. Power analysis is done via simulation. 
    Includes tools for simulating single data sets and 
    visualizing power analysis results.
