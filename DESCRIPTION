Description: Power analysis for regression models which test the interaction of
    two independent variables on a single dependent variable. Includes options 
    for continuous, binary, and/or skewed variables, as well as correlated 
    interacting variables. Also includes options to specify variable reliability.
    Power analyses can be done either analytically or via simulation.  Includes 
    tools for simulating single data sets and visualizing power analysis results.
    The primary functions are 'power_interaction_r2' and 'power_interaction'.
