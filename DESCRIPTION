Description: Power analysis for regression models which test the interaction 
    of two independent variables on a single dependent variable. All 
    variables are continuous and normally distributed, and may be correlated.
    Power analysis is done via simulation. Includes tools for simulating 
    single data sets and visualizing power analysis results.
