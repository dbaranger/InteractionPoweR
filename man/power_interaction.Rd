\arguments{
\item{n.iter}{Number of iterations. The number of simulations to run for each unique setting combination. Must be a positive integer.}

\item{N}{Sample size. Must be a positive integer. Has no default value. Can be a single value or a vector of values.}

\item{r.x1.y}{Pearson's correlation between x1 and y. Must be between -1 and 1.. Has no default value. Can be a single value or a vector of values.}

\item{r.x2.y}{Pearson's correlation between x2 and y. Must be between -1 and 1.. Assumed to be the 'moderator' in some functions. Has no default value. Can be a single value or a vector of values.}

\item{r.x1x2.y}{Pearson's correlation between the interaction term x1x2 (x1 * x2) and y. Must be between -1 and 1.. Has no default value. Can be a single value or a vector of values.}

\item{r.x1.x2}{Pearson's correlation between x1 and x2. Must be between -1 and 1.. Has no default value. Can be a single value or a vector of values.}

\item{rel_x1}{Reliability of x1 (e.g. test-retest reliability, ICC, Cronbach's alpha). Default is 1 (perfect reliability). Must be greater than 0 and less than or equal to 1.}

\item{rel_x2}{Reliability of x2 (e.g. test-retest reliability, ICC, Cronbach's alpha). Default is 1 (perfect reliability). Must be greater than 0 and less than or equal to 1.}

\item{rel_y}{Reliability of xy (e.g. test-retest reliability, ICC, Cronbach's alpha). Default is 1 (perfect reliability). Must be greater than 0 and less than or equal to 1.}

\item{alpha}{The alpha. At what p-value is the interaction deemed significant? Default is 0.05.}

\item{q}{Simple slopes. How many quantiles should x2 be split into for simple slope testing? Default is 2. Simple slope testing returns the effect-size (slope) of y~x1 for the two most extreme quantiles of x2. If q=3 then the two slopes are y~x1 for the bottom 33\% of x2, and the top 33\% of x2.}

\item{cl}{Number of clusters to use for running simulations in parallel (recommended). Default is 1 (i.e. not in parallel).}

\item{ss.IQR}{Simple slope IQR. Multiplier when estimating the distribution of simple slopes within each simulation setting. Default is 1.5.}

\item{detailed_results}{Default is FALSE. Should detailed results be reported (mean of effect size and correlations for each setting)?}

\item{full_simulation}{Default is FALSE. If TRUE, will return a list that includes the full per-simulation results.}
}
\value{
A data frame containing the power (\% significant results) for each unique setting combination. If full_simulation = TRUE will return a list, with one data frame that includes power, and a second that includes raw simulation results.
}
\description{
Power analysis for interaction models, by simulation. A set of n.iter simulations is run for each unique combination of model settings.
